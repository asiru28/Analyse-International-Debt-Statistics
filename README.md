# Analyse-International-Debt-Statistics

# Overview

Humans and nations alike take on debt for various purposes, such as managing economic growth, infrastructure development, and financial stability. The World Bank plays a crucial role in providing debt to developing countries to support these objectives. This project analyses international debt data to understand the debt distribution among different nations and the indicators associated with it.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine the number of distinct countries present in the dataset.
- To identify the country with the highest amount of debt.
- To find the country with the lowest amount of repayments.

# Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from The World Bank, which contains information about the debt owed by developing nations across various categories.

# Tools Used

- SQL (for querying the dataset)
- datalab (for executing and sharing the analysis)

# Insights

- The dataset includes debt indicators for various developing countries.
- The total number of distinct countries present in the dataset is 124.
- Debt accumulation varies significantly between countries, with some nations having an overwhelming share of total debt.
- Repayment amounts also differ greatly, highlighting disparities in financial management among countries.

# Key Findings

- Highest Debt: China holds the highest amount of debt, with a total of approximately $285.79 billion.
- Lowest Repayment: Timor-Leste has the lowest recorded repayment amount of $825,000.
- The dataset provides a broad perspective on the financial obligations of developing nations and their ability to manage debt repayments.

# Recommendations

- Developing nations should focus on sustainable debt management practices to avoid financial instability.
- Countries with high debt burdens should implement strategies to enhance economic productivity and improve repayment capabilities.
- Policymakers and international financial organisations should consider providing debt relief or restructuring options for nations struggling with repayments.
